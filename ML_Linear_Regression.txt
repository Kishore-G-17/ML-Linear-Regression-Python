Linear Regression:
-> Regression is used to find the target value from independent predictors.
-> More clearly It is used to find the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
-> Linear Regression model is used depend upon the data set we are having.
-> The output of the linear regression  is a Linear straight line equation ( y = mx + b)
-> y: Dependent variable.
-> x: Independent variable.
-> m: Slope (or) gradient.
